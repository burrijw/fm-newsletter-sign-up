## My process

### Built with

-   React & Typescript
-   Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I wanted to really dive deep in accessibility with this one, so I tested everything with voiceover and auditing tools as I went along. I discovered some bugs and weird behavior with Safari and VO:

-   VO will not accounce a list as such when the list-style-type is `none`.
