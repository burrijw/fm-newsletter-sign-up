## My process

### Built with

-   React & Typescript
-   Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I wanted to really dive deep in accessibility with this one, so I tested everything with voiceover and auditing tools as I went along. I discovered some bugs and weird behavior with Safari and VO:

-   VO will not accounce a list as such when the list-style-type is `none`.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-   [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
